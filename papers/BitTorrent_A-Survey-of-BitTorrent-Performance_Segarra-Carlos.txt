Comments (to be returned to the author(s))

1. WHAT, in your opinion, are the most original contributions of this
paper?

An in-depth literature review of the design, performance, and enhancmenets of the BitTorrent P2P file-sharing protocol.

2. WHAT, in your opinion, is the significance of the paper?  What
aspects of the paper are likely to be used by other researchers and/or
practitioners?

The main significance of the paper is that it encompasses together several (filtered) resources about Bittorrent, providing a great starting point for new researchers trying to enter the field, or established ones looking for quality references.

3. What was the most challenging, but important, thing to understand
about the paper? Give an example of the concept, what your confusions
were/are, and why it is important. (In other words, don't choose
something that was challenging because it was poorly explained, but is
also not important. Choose something that IS important but that was a
difficult concept to grasp)

The most important part is being able to distill the important concepts (architecutrally and performance enhancning hints) from the vast amount of information available.

4. Please detail any technical errors, uncited related work, and/or ways
in which the technical material could be improved.

Include a TL-DR section to grasp a general idea of the conclusions they reach.

5. Any additional comments for the authors (e.g., how might the paper be further improved beyond 1--4 above?).

6. Please highlight the most important insights that have you have learnt from the paper?

The paper provides a great introduction to BitTorrent and more generally peer-to-peer communication protocols, and is very explicative, educative, and well written.

7. Do you think this paper should be included in next year's DS course?

Yes

Summary
Please summarize the paper in your own words

This paper does an in-depth dive into BitTorrent, and surveys performance studies from 2003 to 2008 on this peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol.
It also surveys the suggested enhancments proposed by the analyzed works.

BitTorrent is a P2P file sharing system which organizes peers that are interested in downloading the same file into an overlay network called a Torrent.
Contrary to other trditional systems, BitTorrent relies on cooperation among peers for downloading files, and peers are expected to use a centralized search facility.
BitTorrent implementations ignore the underlying topology and as a consequence result in large amounts of cross-ISP traffic.

The steps in sharing a file are: download the .torrent file, contact the tracker, connect to peers, and exchange the file by pieces.
The main mechanisms employed by BitTorrent consist in peer and piece selection strategies.

Then the authors provide a very in-depth study of the performance analysis of BitTorrent in the literature.
