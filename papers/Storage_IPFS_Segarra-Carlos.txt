Comments (to be returned to the author(s))

1. WHAT, in your opinion, are the most original contributions of this
paper?

An integrated decentralized peer-to-peer solution for distributed applications and distributed largescale file sharing.

2. WHAT, in your opinion, is the significance of the paper?  What
aspects of the paper are likely to be used by other researchers and/or
practitioners?

The whole construction is, per se, very novel and (if materialized) could really revolutionize the SoA.

3. What was the most challenging, but important, thing to understand
about the paper? Give an example of the concept, what your confusions
were/are, and why it is important. (In other words, don't choose
something that was challenging because it was poorly explained, but is
also not important. Choose something that IS important but that was a
difficult concept to grasp)

The block exchange protocol and the different strategies each peer could follow.

4. Please detail any technical errors, uncited related work, and/or ways
in which the technical material could be improved.

5. Any additional comments for the authors (e.g., how might the paper be further improved beyond 1--4 above?).

6. Please highlight the most important insights that have you have learnt from the paper?

I have learnt about IPFS in general.

7. Do you think this paper should be included in next year's DS course?

Yes

Summary
Please summarize the paper in your own words

The paper introduces a decentralized VCS for P2P systems with high throughput and availability.
Then it summarizes what IPFS takes from the most succesful distributed systems, namely: DHT, BitTorrent, Version Control Systems, and Self-Certified Systems.
IPFS introduces a new model for distributing and versioning large data, and deploying distributed applications.
The protocol is divided in seven functionalities: Identities, Network, Routing, Exchange, Objects, Files, and Naming.

One of the biggest contributions of the paper is BitSwap, a BitTorrent inspired distributed data sharing protocol.
The main difference with the latter, is that BitSwap's nodes are not limites to listening to blocks from a single torrent.
In fact, the system operates as a marketplace, which requires some sort of incentivized currency (to be defined).
With this incentives, nodes are stimulated to disseminate rare pieces even if they don't want them in particular.
Further, a complex credit and debt system is established so that each node follows its own strategy.
Differently to BitTorrent, where a standard strategy (tit-for-tat) is specified, a range could be implemented by peers in the IPFS block exchange network.

Another big contribution of the IPFS protocol is the design of the so-called Merkle DAG, to perform Git-inspired version control system on arbitrarily large data files.
