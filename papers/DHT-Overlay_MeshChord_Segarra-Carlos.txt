Comments (to be returned to the author(s))

1. WHAT, in your opinion, are the most original contributions of this
paper?

The locality and corss-layering techniques for wireless networks.

2. WHAT, in your opinion, is the significance of the paper?  What
aspects of the paper are likely to be used by other researchers and/or
practitioners?

The two improvements they suggest over Chord: enhancing locality and MAC cross-layering could very well be used in other applications targeted to wireless mesh networks.

3. What was the most challenging, but important, thing to understand
about the paper? Give an example of the concept, what your confusions
were/are, and why it is important. (In other words, don't choose
something that was challenging because it was poorly explained, but is
also not important. Choose something that IS important but that was a
difficult concept to grasp)

The improvements over the Chord protocol.

4. Please detail any technical errors, uncited related work, and/or ways
in which the technical material could be improved.

In the evaluation section they could also compare against other protocols (not only Chord based) in my opinion, they do indeed show that they improve Chord, but not how good they are in absolute terms.

5. Any additional comments for the authors (e.g., how might the paper be further improved beyond 1--4 above?).

6. Please highlight the most important insights that have you have learnt from the paper?

The explanation of the Chord protocol together with the enhancements they suggest is very easy to follow.

7. Do you think this paper should be included in next year's DS course?

Yes

Summary
Please summarize the paper in your own words

This paper presents an enhancement of the Chord protocol called MeshChord, specially designed for wireless mesh networks.
In particular, they account two main differences between wired p2p networks for which Chord was originally designed and wireless mesh networks: i) availability of wireless infrastructure, and the 1-hop broadcast nature.

The architecture is divided in two: a bottom tier containing the mobile clients (hosting and requesting access to resources) and an upper tier mainatining a DHT of who owns which resources.
For the DHT, the authors stick with Chord.

The first modification introduced to the basic Chord design is the introduction of locality concerns to assign ID to peers (not using SHA1 anymore, yes for files/resources).

The second modification is the usage of MAC cross-layering, in which a random peer may capture packets, sniff their content, and potentially send it's ID to the sender if it has information about the requested key.

The evaluation section is complete and shows an improvement over different S.o.A implementations.
