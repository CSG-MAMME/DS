Comments (to be returned to the author(s))

1. WHAT, in your opinion, are the most original contributions of this
paper?

Written in 2009 and started in 2000, this paper presents a very novel and powerful architecture for distributed computing, and a great alternative to advance science.

2. WHAT, in your opinion, is the significance of the paper?  What
aspects of the paper are likely to be used by other researchers and/or
practitioners?

It opens the door for many alike projects, which in turn would surpass the current computing limitations many research groups face.

3. What was the most challenging, but important, thing to understand
about the paper? Give an example of the concept, what your confusions
were/are, and why it is important. (In other words, don't choose
something that was challenging because it was poorly explained, but is
also not important. Choose something that IS important but that was a
difficult concept to grasp)

The most important concept to understand is the underlying architecture since it can be ported to many different projects.
In particular, how to properly chunk the work and dettach the working unit from the client itself.

4. Please detail any technical errors, uncited related work, and/or ways
in which the technical material could be improved.

The authors do not provide any formal evaluation, nor provide speedup or performance measures.

5. Any additional comments for the authors (e.g., how might the paper be further improved beyond 1--4 above?).

6. Please highlight the most important insights that have you have learnt from the paper?

A very novel architecture for volunteer computing (which even today looks novel).
However, I think with the current scaling of supercomputing, and cloud-computing, this might be losing interest.

7. Do you think this paper should be included in next year's DS course?

Yes

Summary
Please summarize the paper in your own words

The paper summarizes Folding@Home, a distributed computing system to substitute large datacenters for biomedical computing.

Motivated by the need of powerful resources in order to perform mollecular folding simulations, the authors study volunteer computing: distributed computing where the work is done on computers recruited from people on the Internet.

After an introduction of the background scientific concepts, the authors go on to describe the architecture of Folding@Home.
The first building block are client nodes, run by volunteers.
The authors put emphasis on how they dettached the client itself, from the actual work (core) that needs to be done, and which is downloaded from a link provided by the work server.
Additionally, clients also have the ability to see the experiment they are performing.

On the server side, and as previously mentioned, work servers are the responsible to assign batches of works to clients, and to aggregate the results.
The connection between the work servers and the clients is done through the assignment servers, which act as load-balancers and whose address is the only one the clients need to know.
Lastly, the collection servers act as buffers for when work servers are down.

The system supports a wide-range of different architectures and has a set of disseminative tools to keep volunteers engaged and to enhane the recruiting process.
