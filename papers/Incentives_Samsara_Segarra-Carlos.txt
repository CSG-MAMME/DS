PAPER #:
Title of the Paper: "Samsara: Honor AMong Thieves in Peer-to-Peer Storage"
Author(s): Landon P. Cox, Brian D. Noble
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments (to be returned to the author(s))

1. WHAT, in your opinion, are the most original contributions of this
paper?

A scheme to ensure fairness in peer-to-peer storage systems without any additional constraints on the mesh.

2. WHAT, in your opinion, is the significance of the paper?  What
aspects of the paper are likely to be used by other researchers and/or
practitioners?

As stated by the authors, even though their implementation targets Pastiche, it can be applied to any other peer-to-peer storage system.

3. What was the most challenging, but important, thing to understand
about the paper? Give an example of the concept, what your confusions
were/are, and why it is important. (In other words, don't choose
something that was challenging because it was poorly explained, but is
also not important. Choose something that IS important but that was a
difficult concept to grasp)

The most important concept to understand are storage claims, i.e. how they create "fake" symmetry in order to ensure fairness.

4. Please detail any technical errors, uncited related work, and/or ways
in which the technical material could be improved.

5. Any additional comments for the authors (e.g., how might the paper be further improved beyond 1--4 above?).

6. Please highlight the most important insights that have you have learnt from the paper?

The paper presents a very novel, interesting, and smart policy for ensuring fairnes in storage p2p system, and also provide a very detailed evaluation of it.

7. Do you think this paper should be included in next year's DS course?

Yes.

Summary
Please summarize the paper in your own words

The paper is motivated by the fact that p2p storage systems depend on (rely on) individual nodes conumint storage space in proportion to their contribution, otherwise the system collapses.
Alternatives in the SoA require some sort of additional property contrary to the p2p essence (trusted third parties, centralized elements, or symmetry).
The authors present Samsara, an infrastructure to enforce fairness in such systems without the additional constraints.
Their solution bases on creating symmetry through the introduction of "storage claims" futures that can be later exchanged by true data storage.

In order to reduce storage overhead, a node can forward storage claims to other nodes with higher available memory.
However, forwarding node is still responsible of the claims he has forwarded, so if the other node acts maliciously they would be penalized.

Samsara's design goal is to ensure that nodes consume no more resources than they contribute.
To enforce equal exchange, nodes are only probabilistically punished if a query to them fails, however, cheating nodes will eventually lose data.
Queries to prove that you still store data can be answered by simple hashes rather than proof of the full objects.
Also, a grace-period to answer queries is established so unlucky nodes (which experience failures) are not penalized.
To balance this grace-period with protection against smart attacks, the authors present a probabilistic method for dropping object replicas as queries fail.
One big design consideration they make is that they protect mostly against greedy nodes rather than just malicious ones.

After the design and implementation section, the authors go on to develop a very detailed benchmark of the system, both from a micro and macro benchmark perspective.
It is specially interesting that they compare themselves against `scp` with comparable results, which I think is surprising.
