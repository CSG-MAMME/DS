Comments (to be returned to the author(s))

1. WHAT, in your opinion, are the most original contributions of this
paper?

The design of Ethereum's blockchain.

2. WHAT, in your opinion, is the significance of the paper?  What
aspects of the paper are likely to be used by other researchers and/or
practitioners?

The paper presents a novel ground-breaking result.
It has proven to be one of the major breakthroughs in the last decade.

3. What was the most challenging, but important, thing to understand
about the paper? Give an example of the concept, what your confusions
were/are, and why it is important. (In other words, don't choose
something that was challenging because it was poorly explained, but is
also not important. Choose something that IS important but that was a
difficult concept to grasp)

Why ether and gas are pinnacle in the stability of the system.

4. Please detail any technical errors, uncited related work, and/or ways
in which the technical material could be improved.

It is a white paper so not a lot of technical detail is required, however it may be too descriptive at some points (maybe too much dissemination).

5. Any additional comments for the authors (e.g., how might the paper be further improved beyond 1--4 above?).

6. Please highlight the most important insights that have you have learnt from the paper?

The functioning of Ethereum and it's main differences with Bitcoin (and why an alternative was necessary).

7. Do you think this paper should be included in next year's DS course?

Yes

Summary
Please summarize the paper in your own words

This paper presents the founational concepts behind the Ethereum blockchain together with a description of its building blocks.
The essential difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is that the former's blockchain aims to provide a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language to create a sort of contracts denoted "smart contracts".

Firstly, the author introduces Bitcoin and it's blockchain: depicts it's functionality, explains Merkle trees, and covers some of the major applications built atop Bitcoin.
The summary finishes talking about BTC's scripting language and its main constraints: lack of Turing completeness, UTXO undivisibility, lack of different states, and non-awareness of the Blockchain.
These limitations act as driving forces for the development of Ethereum.

The intent of Ethereum is to improve the scripting language to allow developers to create arbitrary consensus-based applications.
Ethereum builds a blockchain with a Turing-complete programming language.
It's building blocks are accounts (external controlled by private keys, and contracts controlled by their contract code) and ether is the internal crypto-fuel.
In order to prevent computational blowup, Ethereum transactions must include an approximate amount of computational steps and the amount they are willing to pay a miner to perform then.

Code is programmed in a DSL and executed in an Ethereum Virtual Machine.
It is a stack-based language similar in essence to BTCs but with Turing completeness.

Lastly, the author presents some possible applications in the financial domain, and other decentralized applications (and DAOs).

As for the mining process Ethereum's goal is to mitigate the impact of: specialized hardware and mining pools.
However, the author does not provide details of the chosen mining methodology (although it is based in PoW as well).
