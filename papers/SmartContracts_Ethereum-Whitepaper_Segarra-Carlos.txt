Author(s): Vitalik Buterin

Comments (to be returned to the author(s))

1. WHAT, in your opinion, are the most original contributions of this
paper?

An in-depth literature review of the design, performance, and enhancmenets of the BitTorrent P2P file-sharing protocol.

2. WHAT, in your opinion, is the significance of the paper?  What
aspects of the paper are likely to be used by other researchers and/or
practitioners?

The main significance of the paper is that it encompasses together several (filtered) resources about Bittorrent, providing a great starting point for new researchers trying to enter the field, or established ones looking for quality references.

3. What was the most challenging, but important, thing to understand
about the paper? Give an example of the concept, what your confusions
were/are, and why it is important. (In other words, don't choose
something that was challenging because it was poorly explained, but is
also not important. Choose something that IS important but that was a
difficult concept to grasp)

The most important part is being able to distill the important concepts (architecutrally and performance enhancning hints) from the vast amount of information available.

4. Please detail any technical errors, uncited related work, and/or ways
in which the technical material could be improved.

Include a TL-DR section to grasp a general idea of the conclusions they reach.

5. Any additional comments for the authors (e.g., how might the paper be further improved beyond 1--4 above?).

6. Please highlight the most important insights that have you have learnt from the paper?

The paper provides a great introduction to BitTorrent and more generally peer-to-peer communication protocols, and is very explicative, educative, and well written.

7. Do you think this paper should be included in next year's DS course?

Yes

Summary
Please summarize the paper in your own words

This paper presents the founational concepts behind the Ethereum blockchain together with a description of its building blocks.
The essential difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is that the former's blockchain aims to provide a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language to create a sort of contracts denoted "smart contracts".

Firstly, the author introduces Bitcoin and it's blockchain: depicts it's functionality, explains Merkle trees, and covers some of the major applications built atop Bitcoin.
The summary finishes talking about BTC's scripting language and its main constraints: lack of Turing completeness, UTXO undivisibility, lack of different states, and non-awareness of the Blockchain.
These limitations act as driving forces for the development of Ethereum.

The intent of Ethereum is to improve the scripting language to allow developers to create arbitrary consensus-based applications.
Ethereum builds a blockchain with a Turing-complete programming language.
