Comments (to be returned to the author(s))

1. WHAT, in your opinion, are the most original contributions of this
paper?

The definition of a strategy to optimize the routing in Bittorrent using an ALTO-compliant, centralized, architecture.

2. WHAT, in your opinion, is the significance of the paper?  What
aspects of the paper are likely to be used by other researchers and/or
practitioners?

In my opinion the paper is of low significance, as it showcases a prototype whose design is not very novel or original, neither the provided evaluation results encouraging.

3. What was the most challenging, but important, thing to understand
about the paper? Give an example of the concept, what your confusions
were/are, and why it is important. (In other words, don't choose
something that was challenging because it was poorly explained, but is
also not important. Choose something that IS important but that was a
difficult concept to grasp)

The most important concept to grab is the workflow of the system, which is greatly described in Figure 1.

4. Please detail any technical errors, uncited related work, and/or ways
in which the technical material could be improved.

The evaluation section lacks a lot of work. In particular:
- They don't ask the right questions.
- They don't show what they want to show.
- They don't compare agains who they want to compare.

5. Any additional comments for the authors (e.g., how might the paper be further improved beyond 1--4 above?).

6. Please highlight the most important insights that have you have learnt from the paper?

What the Aplication Layer Traffic Optimization protocol is about and how they enforce it from regulating bodies.

7. Do you think this paper should be included in next year's DS course?

No.

Summary
Please summarize the paper in your own words

The paper presents a hierarchichal peer organization to optimize traffic usage in p2p applications in wireless mesh networks.
By traffic usage, the authors focus on latency and number of exchanged messages, focusing on maximixing locality.
To this extent, they implement a hierarchical ALTO service that globally order peers to be returned to the BitTorrent tracker, where nodes are sorted according to their distance to the asking peer.

In the background section they depict the functioning of the tracker-based Bittorrent protocol, and most notably the "Application Layer Traffic Optimization" (ALTO) which they base their development on.
The proposed design consits of a three-step, hierarchical, protocol:
- 1st: they divide a wireless mesh netowrk in "regions" managed by a WMN Agnet.
- 2nd: each "region" is ordered in terms of AS-distance (minimum number of hops to the closest AS) -> Inter-Region Traffic Optimization
- 3rd: within each region, nodes are sorted by proximity to the network agent.
All the information is centralized in an ALTO server.

Questions

+ What is the actual contribution of the work?

+ Evaluation
    + What added value do experiments provide? Are they representative of the work being presented?
    + In other words, are they showing what they want to prove?
    + Are results statistically relevant?
    + Do they compare against other solutions?

+ Is the definition of a centralized ALTO server coherent with the distributed p2p setting?
