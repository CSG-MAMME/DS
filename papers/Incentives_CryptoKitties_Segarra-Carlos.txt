Comments (to be returned to the author(s))

1. WHAT, in your opinion, are the most original contributions of this
paper?

The introduction to the blockchain environment of concepts such as digital collectibles, non-fungible assets and decreasing auctions.

2. WHAT, in your opinion, is the significance of the paper?  What
aspects of the paper are likely to be used by other researchers and/or
practitioners?

In my opionion the significance of the paper is rather limited, as it is a whitepaper of something they have developed, and in the end want people to use.

3. What was the most challenging, but important, thing to understand
about the paper? Give an example of the concept, what your confusions
were/are, and why it is important. (In other words, don't choose
something that was challenging because it was poorly explained, but is
also not important. Choose something that IS important but that was a
difficult concept to grasp)

As it is a whitepaper, it lacks a lot of technical detail, so they don't really explain their technology.

4. Please detail any technical errors, uncited related work, and/or ways
in which the technical material could be improved.

As with most of the blockchain projects they try to differentiate from, they do more of a marketing job than a disseminative/educative one.

5. Any additional comments for the authors (e.g., how might the paper be further improved beyond 1--4 above?).

6. Please highlight the most important insights that have you have learnt from the paper?

7. Do you think this paper should be included in next year's DS course?

No.

Summary
Please summarize the paper in your own words

The motivation for this whitepaper is that "the public perception of blockchain applications is increasingly narrow-minded and short-sighted".
The authors argue that the raise of Cryptocurrencies has made Blockchain developers short-sighted and not ambitious-enough to aim for real development.
On the contrary, they pretend to exploit and develop the concept of digital scarcity and digital collectibles.

Digital collectibles, comparable to real-world art, are online goods which currently lack a purpose and are limited by:
+ The necessity of a central issuing authority.
+ Dependency of such central provider.
+ Lack of function.
The authors propose the creation of CryptoKitties as a digital collectible.
The project also has an educative goal through gamification of some blockchain concepts.

Contrary to most blockchain projects, their funding mechanism won't be through an ICO, but rather through sells of their digital collectibles.
They plan to do so by introducing non-fungible tokens (tokens which don't devaluate) and a reverse auctioning mechanism.
