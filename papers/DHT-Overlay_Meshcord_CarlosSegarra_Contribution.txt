Q: Do you think the proposal is good or not? Why? How about other techniques, e.g. flooding, to find reources/content in a WMN?
Unfortunately, the authors only compare against other DHT-based (Chord modifications, in fact) resource sharing techniques, so it's difficult to make an educated guess.
However, I would say that the proposed technique would have less impact on the bandwidth and scales to more nodes.

Q: About the computational cost needed to use location awareness and cross layering in key-based routing?
In my opinion location awareness comes almost for granted with the infrastructure.
However, it is true that, without further details, it is complicated to know the computational cost of the cross-layering.
According to the authors, a node sniffs packets that it intercepts, but it does not specify how "curious" a node has to be in order for this technique to achieve noticeable results.
It is possible that the computational overhead introduced by this cross-layering turned out to be not-desirable for nodes in the mesh.

Q: Do you think the approach can be generalized?
I am not sure was that the asker mean with generalized, but I think the concepts could be reused in other protocols applied to wireless mesh networks.

Q: How would you improve the presented work?
The authors could provide further details on the computational cost of the additional techniques they suggest.
Further, they could compare against other resource-sharing techniques in WMN non DHT-based for instance.
