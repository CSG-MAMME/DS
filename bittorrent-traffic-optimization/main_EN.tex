    \begin{alertblock}{Main Contribution}
        The paper presents a \textbf{hierarchichal peer organization} to optimize Bittorrent's bandwidth usage in wireless mesh networks.
    \end{alertblock}

    \begin{block}{Techniques}
        The authors base on the \textbf{Application Layer Traffic Optimization Service} which provides the peers with knowledge about the underlying network.
    \end{block}

    \begin{alertblock}{Evaluation Results}
        They report a $27\%$ time reduction in \textbf{download time} and a $66\%$ inter-region \textbf{traffic} reduction.

            \textbf{Tracker-Based Bittorrent Protocol:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Bittorrent} is a peer-to-peer communication protocol for file sharing.
                \item A \textbf{Bittorrent} tracker is a server that assists in the communication between peers.
                \item It keeps track of where file copies reside.
            \end{itemize}
            \textbf{The ALTO Service Architecture:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The \textbf{\href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7285}{Application Layer Traffic Optimization}} services provide network information with the goal of modifying network resources consumption.

                \item Server aggregates responses and returns sorted list to Tracker.
