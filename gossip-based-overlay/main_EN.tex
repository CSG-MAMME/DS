    \begin{alertblock}{Main Contribution}
        The paper presents \textsc{T-Man} a \textbf{gossip-based protocol} to address the \textbf{topology management problem} in large-scale, dynamic networks.
    \end{alertblock}

    \begin{block}{Techniques}
        The authors introduce a generalized per-node \textbf{ranking function} to sort the set of peers even in the presence of \textbf{network churn}.
    \end{block}

    \begin{alertblock}{Evaluation Results}
        Results show a \textbf{logarithmic} dependence between the convergence rate and the network size, and a good reliability in the presence of high churn rates.
    \end{alertblock}

    \framesubtitle{Gossip-Based Protocols}

    \textbf{Gossip Protocol:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{gossip protocol}} is a procedure of computer peer-to-peer communication.
        \item It is based on the way \textbf{epidemics} spread (very handy).
        \item Each node disseminates the information to communicate to all it's neighbours. Effectively \textbf{flooding} the network.
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Some Examples:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribler}{Tribler:} is a BitTorrent peer to peer client using gossip protocols.
        \item Gossip protocols are used to achieve and maintain distributed databases' consistency.
        \item Gossip protocols are also widely used in routing.
    \end{itemize}

            \textbf{The Topology Management Problem:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item There are a set of \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{nodes}} connected through a routed network. Each node has:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item A uniquely identifiable address \texttt{c}
                    \item A node descriptor object with relevant information.
                    \item A \textbf{partial view}: a subset of the nodes.
                \end{itemize}
                \item The set of partial views make up the \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{overlay network topology}}.
            \end{itemize}
            \textbf{Topology Management Problem:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item How to dynamically modify the \textit{partial views} so that the overlay network converges to a \textbf{target topology}?
            \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \texttt{selectPeer} method uses a rank function to determin the best peer, and the \texttt{merge} one takes the $n$ top-ranked peers.
        \item Interesting to observe the use of a random view in the algorithm (more on that later).

    \framesubtitle{Or should I say simulations?}

    \textbf{Simulation Experiments:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simulations done using \textit{PeerSim} on large networks.
        \item Authors compare three distance-based rank functions: linear, binary tree, and torus.
        \item They measure convergence and missing links to achieve target topology.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Experiments}
    \framesubtitle{Results}

    \textbf{Simulation Results:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Authors report logarithmic convergence with respect to network size.
        \item Full topology convergence is slower as some links are \textit{"hard"} to get.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Network Churn}
    \framesubtitle{Definition, Importance, and Solution}

    One of the biggest motivations for the work was to be able to deal with \textbf{network churn}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Netowrk churn}} happens when nodes constantly leave and join the network.
        \item How can we achieve our target topology (or maintain it) in such scenario?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Authors introduce an \textit{aging} factor in the rank function, to discard \textbf{dead} links.
            \item Convergence is still reasonable even under high churn rates.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    The authors say that they are working in using \textsc{T-Man} in existing DHT implementations to provide with \textbf{robustness} in the event of massive failures and extreme churn.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Is churn something current decentralized protocols are still worried about?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Open Questions}

    Lastly, \textbf{some questions:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Do you think gossip protocols still play a role in nowadays decentralized systems?
        \item Why do you think the authors include a random view in the algorithm? What is it used for?
        \item Very often, the mathematics of epidemics are used to model gossip communications. Do you think our experience with gossip protocols could help us better understand the current pandemic? (Open question: do you think there exists a feedback relation between models that mimic natural behaviours, once these are put in production and stressed?)
    \end{enumerate}
